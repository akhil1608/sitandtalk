<h2>Our Values</h2>
<h4><strong>MISSION:</strong> To Serve The best to our Customers</h4> 
<p><strong>

It happens millions of times each week – a customer receives a drink from a Sit And Talk barista – but each interaction is unique.

Starbucks Front Of Original Pike Place Store
It’s just a moment in time – just one hand reaching over the counter to present a cup to another outstretched hand.

But it’s a connection.

We make sure everything we do honors that connection – from our commitment to the highest quality coffee in the world, to the way we engage with our customers and communities to do business responsibly.

From our beginnings as a single store over forty years ago, in every place that we’ve been, and every place that we touch, we've tried to make it a little better than we found it.
